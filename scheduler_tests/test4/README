This tests if preemption works correctly when a new task with a higher priority is created. 
A task is started with the priority of 15. 
It creates a child task (initially with the same priority), and then sets its priority to 11. 
At this point, the child should take over and execute until completion, because
the age threshold is set high. 
Only then should the parent finish. 
The output should look like this:

Parent started
Child started
....................................................................................................
Child done
Parent done
