Here we have three processes with different priorities. 
At the beginning, A should get most of the CPU with B and C getting an occasional timeslice due to ageing. 
B should get the CPU twice as often as C. 
After A finishes, B gets most of the CPU, with C getting its timeslices due to ageing. Then B finishes and C executes alone.
Output should look roughly like this:

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCAAAAAAABBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBAAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAAABBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBAAAAAAACCCCCCCABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
